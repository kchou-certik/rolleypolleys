## Uploading images
1. Upload transparent PNGs to assets/images - don't put anything in the folder except images you want to use!
2. Images will automatically be added via Jekyll.  Please note GitHub Pages may take a bit of time to update the page. 
3. Navigate to https://kchou94.github.io/rolleypolleys/

## Creating marquee
1. In OBS, create a browser source 4096px wide and capture the rolleypolley page
2. Apply a filter to the source to scroll
3. If updating CSS etc., make sure to refresh your browser cache (in source settings for OBS - to do this on chrome press ctrl-shift-R)
